# MUBI Data Analysis and Database Normalization

This project involves loading, cleaning, normalizing, and analyzing a dataset from MUBI, a film streaming and social platform. The primary goals are to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), create a normalized SQLite database from the raw CSV data, and then query this database to answer specific business questions. Visualizations are also generated based on these queries.

This repository contains work for Mini Project 2 & 3 for the EAS503 course at SUNY Buffalo.

## Dataset

The project utilizes several CSV files from a MUBI dataset, which should be placed in a `data/` directory in the project root. These files include information about movies, users, ratings, and lists. The expected files are:

*   `mubi_lists_data.csv`
*   `mubi_lists_user_data.csv`
*   `mubi_movie_data.csv`
*   `mubi_ratings_data.csv`
*   `mubi_ratings_user_data.csv`

## Project Structure

*   **`normalize.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for:
    *   Loading and preprocessing the raw CSV data.
    *   Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    *   Normalizing the data into a relational schema.
    *   Storing the normalized data into an SQLite database (`mubi_normalized.db`).
    *   Executing SQL queries to answer defined business questions.
    *   Generating visualizations for the findings.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.
*   **`mubi_normalized.db`**: (Generated by the notebook) An SQLite database containing the normalized MUBI data.
*   **`images/`**: (Generated by the notebook) A directory where plots and visualizations are saved.
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories intentionally untracked by Git (e.g., `data/`, `*.db`, `__pycache__/`).
*   **`LICENSE`**: Contains the MIT License for this project.
*   **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Prepare Data:**
    *   Create a directory named `data` in the root of the project if it doesn't already exist.
    *   Download the MUBI CSV files and place them into the `data/` directory.

### Running the Analysis

1.  **Start Jupyter:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

2.  **Open and Run the Notebook:**
    *   In the Jupyter interface, open the `normalize.ipynb` notebook.
    *   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
    *   The notebook will:
        *   Load data from the `data/` directory.
        *   Perform normalization and create the `mubi_normalized.db` SQLite database in the project root.
        *   Run SQL queries against the database.
        *   Generate and save plots to the `images/` directory.

## Analysis and Findings

The notebook addresses the following key business questions through SQL queries on the normalized database:

1.  **Top Directors by Average Movie Rating:** Identifies directors whose films are consistently well-received, considering only directors with at least 3 movies rated and movies with at least 20 ratings.
2.  **Most Popular Movies by Number of Ratings:** Lists the top 10 movies that have received the highest volume of ratings, indicating high engagement.
3.  **Subscriber vs. Non-Subscriber Rating Behavior:** Compares average ratings for the top 5 most popular movies (by MUBI's `movie_popularity` score) between users who were subscribers at the time of rating and those who were not.
4.  **Impact of Release Decade on Average Ratings:** Shows the average rating for movies grouped by their decade of release (e.g., 1950s, 1960s), considering movies with at least 50 ratings.
5.  **Most Active List Creators and Their Rating Behavior:** Identifies the top 5 users who have created the most lists and analyzes their typical movie rating scores.

Visualizations for these findings are generated and saved, intended for use in a Medium article.
